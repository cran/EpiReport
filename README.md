similar to the **ECDC Annual Epidemiological Reports** (see

Through standalone functions, the package is specifically designed to
generate each disease-specific output presented in these reports.

The package includes:

- **Table** with the distribution of cases by Member State over the last
  five years `getTableByMS()`
- **Seasonal plot** with the distribution of cases at EU/EEA level, by
  month, over the past five years `getSeason()`
- **Trend plot** with the trend and number of cases at EU/EEA level, by
  month, over the past five years `getTrend()`
- **Age and gender bar graph** with the distribution of cases at EU/EEA
  level `getAgeGender()`

Two types of datasets can be used:

- The default dataset included in the `EpiReport` package which includes
  Denger data for 2015-2019: `EpiReport::DENGUE2019`;
- Any dataset specified as described in the package vignette.
